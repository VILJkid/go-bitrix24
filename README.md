![BX24 API Library](.github/b24-logo.svg?raw=true)

**go-bitrix24** is a Rest API for Bitrix24. You can manage
your application with this library. It contains almost every
API request B24 provides with support of CRUD operations.

## Quick Start / Installation

To get started with **go-bitrix24**, you'll need to do the following:

- Install the latest version of Go.
- Install the **go-bitrix24** package using go get.
- Use the **go-bitrix24** package in your Go code.
- Here's an example of how to install the package:

```
go get github.com/whatcrm/go-bitrix24
```

## Models

**go-bitrix24** includes a package for working with models, which allows you to use just the API and **create your own models**.
This means you can create your own structs and use them with our **go-bitrix24** package, 
even if you don't want to use every field from amoCRM's entities.

Here's the link to [Models](https://github.com/whatcrm/go-bitrix24/models) package and example of how to install the package.

```
go get github.com/whatcrm/go-bitrix24/models
```
